# SYMC Website

## Hello!

Welcome to the source code for my personal website. I made this to have a professional site about myself on the web while exploring web development. I will be updating this site periodically to reflect my life and continually improve the site's design and functionality.

## Tools

This site is hosted on GitHub pages. To make this site I used:
* Bootstrap 3
* Fontawesome 4
* Git
* HTML
* Gulp
* Less
* Namecheap (for the domain)
* Start Bootstrap (see below)


## Start Bootrap

Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](https://www.ironsummitmedia.com/).

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
